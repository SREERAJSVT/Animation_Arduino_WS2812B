# Arduino LED Animation

This Arduino project demonstrates two LED animations using the FastLED library. The animations include a fire effect and bouncing balls on a WS2812B LED strip.

## Features

- Fire effect animation
- Bouncing balls animation
- Smooth transition between animations
- Configurable parameters such as flame height, sparks, and delay duration

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- WS2812B LED strip
- FastLED library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-led-animation.git
   ```

2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the `arduino_led_animation.ino` file.

3. Install the FastLED library if you haven't already. You can do this through the Arduino IDE Library Manager.

4. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.

5. Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE.

6. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

- Adjust the parameters in the code, such as `FlameHeight`, `Sparks`, and `DelayDuration` to customize the animations.

- Run the code on your Arduino and observe the LED strip displaying the fire effect for 5 seconds, followed by the bouncing balls animation.
