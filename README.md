Continuing from where we left off:

```cpp
void setPixelHeatColor(int Pixel, byte temperature)
{
  // Function to set the color of a pixel based on "heat" (temperature)
  // Rescales heat from 0-255 to 0-191
  byte t192 = round((temperature / 255.0) * 191);

  // Calculate ramp up from
  byte heatramp = t192 & 0x3F; // 0...63
  heatramp <<= 2;               // scale up to 0...252

  // Determine color based on the temperature
  if (t192 > 0x80)              // hottest
  {
    leds[Pixel].setRGB(255, 255, heatramp);
  }
  else if (t192 > 0x40)         // middle
  {
    leds[Pixel].setRGB(255, heatramp, 0);
  }
  else                          // coolest
  {
    leds[Pixel].setRGB(heatramp, 0, 0);
  }
}

void runNoAnimation()
{
  // Function to handle the case of no animation
  // Wait for a while before starting the first animation
  if (millis() - animationStartTime >= 500)
  {
    FastLED.clear(); // Clear the LED strip
    currentState = FIRE_EFFECT;
    animationStartTime = millis();
  }
}

void runFireEffect()
{
  // Function to run the fire effect animation
  // Code for fire effect...
}

void runBouncingBalls()
{
  // Function to run the bouncing balls animation
  // Code for bouncing balls effect...
}
```

- **Pixel Heat Color Function:**
  - `void setPixelHeatColor(int Pixel, byte temperature)` sets the color of a pixel based on a simulated "heat" value.

- **No Animation Function:**
  - `void runNoAnimation()` handles the case of no animation.
  - It waits for a while before starting the first animation.

- **Fire Effect Function:**
  - `void runFireEffect()` contains the code to run the fire effect animation.

- **Bouncing Balls Function:**
  - `void runBouncingBalls()` contains the code to run the bouncing balls animation.

The fire effect and bouncing balls functions are not provided in the initial snippet but should be implemented based on your specific requirements.

In summary, the code is designed to switch between different LED animations: no animation, fire effect, and bouncing balls. The `switch` statement in the `loop()` function controls the flow between these animations based on the current state. The fire effect runs for 5 seconds, followed by the bouncing balls animation. The code structure is modular, making it easy to understand and modify each animation independently.

# Arduino LED Animation

This Arduino project demonstrates two LED animations using the FastLED library. The animations include a fire effect and bouncing balls on a WS2812B LED strip.

## Features

- Fire effect animation
- Bouncing balls animation
- Smooth transition between animations
- Configurable parameters such as flame height, sparks, and delay duration

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- WS2812B LED strip
- FastLED library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-led-animation.git
   ```

2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the `arduino_led_animation.ino` file.

3. Install the FastLED library if you haven't already. You can do this through the Arduino IDE Library Manager.

4. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.

5. Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE.

6. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

- Adjust the parameters in the code, such as `FlameHeight`, `Sparks`, and `DelayDuration` to customize the animations.

- Run the code on your Arduino and observe the LED strip displaying the fire effect for 5 seconds, followed by the bouncing balls animation.
