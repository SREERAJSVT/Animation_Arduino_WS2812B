Certainly! Let's go through the provided Arduino code line by line, explaining each section:

```cpp
#include "FastLED.h"
#define NUM_LEDS 150
#define DATA_PIN 6
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB
#define CHIPSET NEOPIXEL
#define BRIGHTNESS 255
#define GRAVITY -9.81
#define h0 1
#define NUM_BALLS 6
```

- **Include FastLED Library:**
  - `#include "FastLED.h"` includes the FastLED library, which is used for controlling addressable LEDs.

- **Define Constants:**
  - `#define NUM_LEDS 150` sets the total number of LEDs in the strip.
  - `#define DATA_PIN 6` specifies the pin connected to the data input of the LED strip.
  - `#define COLOR_ORDER GRB` defines the color order of the LEDs (Green-Red-Blue).
  - `#define CHIPSET NEOPIXEL` sets the LED chipset to NEOPIXEL.
  - `#define BRIGHTNESS 255` sets the LED brightness to its maximum value.
  - `#define GRAVITY -9.81` defines the acceleration due to gravity (negative since it acts downward).
  - `#define h0 1` sets the initial height of the bouncing balls.
  - `#define NUM_BALLS 6` specifies the number of bouncing balls.

```cpp
float h[NUM_BALLS];
float vImpact0 = sqrt(-2 * GRAVITY * h0);
float vImpact[NUM_BALLS];
float tCycle[NUM_BALLS];
int pos[NUM_BALLS];
long tLast[NUM_BALLS];
float COR[NUM_BALLS];
CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];
int FlameHeight = 50;
int Sparks = 50;
int DelayDuration = 10;
```

- **Variable Declarations:**
  - `float h[NUM_BALLS];` represents the height of each bouncing ball.
  - `float vImpact0 = sqrt(-2 * GRAVITY * h0);` calculates the initial impact velocity when a ball is dropped from the specified height.
  - `float vImpact[NUM_BALLS];` stores the impact velocity for each ball.
  - `float tCycle[NUM_BALLS];` tracks the time since the last ground strike for each ball.
  - `int pos[NUM_BALLS];` stores the current position of each ball on the LED strip.
  - `long tLast[NUM_BALLS];` stores the time of the last ground strike for each ball.
  - `float COR[NUM_BALLS];` represents the coefficient of restitution (bounce damping) for each ball.
  - `CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];` defines an array to store the color of each LED.
  - `int FlameHeight = 50;` sets the flame height for the fire effect.
  - `int Sparks = 50;` sets the number of sparks for the fire effect.
  - `int DelayDuration = 10;` specifies the delay duration for the fire effect.

```cpp
enum AnimationState
{
  NO_ANIMATION,
  FIRE_EFFECT,
  BOUNCING_BALLS
};

AnimationState currentState = NO_ANIMATION;
unsigned long animationStartTime;
```

- **Animation State Enumeration:**
  - `enum AnimationState` defines an enumeration to represent different animation states.
  - `NO_ANIMATION`, `FIRE_EFFECT`, and `BOUNCING_BALLS` represent the states of no animation, fire effect, and bouncing balls.
  - `currentState` holds the current animation state.
  - `animationStartTime` records the start time of the current animation.

```cpp
void setup()
{
  // Setup code...
}

void loop()
{
  switch (currentState)
  {
  case NO_ANIMATION:
    runNoAnimation();
    break;
  case FIRE_EFFECT:
    runFireEffect();
    break;
  case BOUNCING_BALLS:
    runBouncingBalls();
    break;
  }
  delay(1);
}
```

- **Setup Function:**
  - `void setup()` is the standard Arduino setup function where initializations are performed.

- **Loop Function:**
  - `void loop()` is the main loop function.
  - It uses a `switch` statement to execute the appropriate animation function based on the current state.



```cpp
void setPixelHeatColor(int Pixel, byte temperature)
{
  // Function to set the color of a pixel based on "heat" (temperature)
  // Rescales heat from 0-255 to 0-191
  byte t192 = round((temperature / 255.0) * 191);

  // Calculate ramp up from
  byte heatramp = t192 & 0x3F; // 0...63
  heatramp <<= 2;               // scale up to 0...252

  // Determine color based on the temperature
  if (t192 > 0x80)              // hottest
  {
    leds[Pixel].setRGB(255, 255, heatramp);
  }
  else if (t192 > 0x40)         // middle
  {
    leds[Pixel].setRGB(255, heatramp, 0);
  }
  else                          // coolest
  {
    leds[Pixel].setRGB(heatramp, 0, 0);
  }
}

void runNoAnimation()
{
  // Function to handle the case of no animation
  // Wait for a while before starting the first animation
  if (millis() - animationStartTime >= 500)
  {
    FastLED.clear(); // Clear the LED strip
    currentState = FIRE_EFFECT;
    animationStartTime = millis();
  }
}

void runFireEffect()
{
  // Function to run the fire effect animation
  // Code for fire effect...
}

void runBouncingBalls()
{
  // Function to run the bouncing balls animation
  // Code for bouncing balls effect...
}
```

- **Pixel Heat Color Function:**
  - `void setPixelHeatColor(int Pixel, byte temperature)` sets the color of a pixel based on a simulated "heat" value.

- **No Animation Function:**
  - `void runNoAnimation()` handles the case of no animation.
  - It waits for a while before starting the first animation.

- **Fire Effect Function:**
  - `void runFireEffect()` contains the code to run the fire effect animation.

- **Bouncing Balls Function:**
  - `void runBouncingBalls()` contains the code to run the bouncing balls animation.

The fire effect and bouncing balls functions are not provided in the initial snippet but should be implemented based on your specific requirements.

In summary, the code is designed to switch between different LED animations: no animation, fire effect, and bouncing balls. The `switch` statement in the `loop()` function controls the flow between these animations based on the current state. The fire effect runs for 5 seconds, followed by the bouncing balls animation. The code structure is modular, making it easy to understand and modify each animation independently.

# Arduino LED Animation

This Arduino project demonstrates two LED animations using the FastLED library. The animations include a fire effect and bouncing balls on a WS2812B LED strip.

## Features

- Fire effect animation
- Bouncing balls animation
- Smooth transition between animations
- Configurable parameters such as flame height, sparks, and delay duration

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- WS2812B LED strip
- FastLED library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-led-animation.git
   ```

2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the `arduino_led_animation.ino` file.

3. Install the FastLED library if you haven't already. You can do this through the Arduino IDE Library Manager.

4. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.

5. Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE.

6. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

- Adjust the parameters in the code, such as `FlameHeight`, `Sparks`, and `DelayDuration` to customize the animations.

- Run the code on your Arduino and observe the LED strip displaying the fire effect for 5 seconds, followed by the bouncing balls animation.
